usage: %MAIN% [options] [URL [PACK|BRANCH]]

Deploy a node application to a StrongLoop process manager

Options:
  -h,--help          Print this message and exit.
  -v,--version       Print version and exit.
  -s,--service SVC   Deploy to service SVC.
  -z,--size SIZE     Set size of cluster to SIZE before deploy.

Arguments:
  SIZE: A number, n, or the string 'cpus', meaning run a worker per CPU.

  SVC: The name or ID of the service on the process manager.

    Defaults to the name of the application specified in the package.json file.

    If a service with that name is not available on the process manager,
    a new service will be created and the application will be deployed.

  URL: The URL of the StrongLoop process manager.

    Defaults to `http://localhost:8701`. If a URL is provided, both the host
    and port is optional, they default to `localhost` and 8701, respectively.
    If the server requires authentication, the credentials must be part of the
    URL, see examples.

    URL may also use the `http+ssh://` protocol which will connect using ssh
    and then tunnel the http requests over that connection. The ssh username
    will default to your current user and authentication defaults to using your
    current ssh-agent. The username can be overridden by setting an `SSH_USER`
    environment variable. The authentication can be overridden to use an
    existing private key instead of an agent by setting the `SSH_KEY`
    environment variable to the path of the private key to be used. The port
    used for ssh can be overridden by setting an `SSH_PORT` environment
    variable.

  PACK: Deploy an NPM package/tarball.

  BRANCH: Deploy a git branch.

Default behaviour is to deploy to `http://localhost:8701`. An npm package from
the parent directory is deployed, if one is found for the current application
version, otherwise the git branch `deploy` is deployed.

Note that if PACK or BRANCH is specified, URL *must* be specified as well.

Examples:

Deploy the default npm package or git branch to localhost:

    %MAIN%

Deploy the default npm package or git branch to a remote host:

    %MAIN% http://prod1.example.com

Deploy to a remote host, on a non-standard port, using authentication:

    %MAIN% http://user:pass@prod1.example.com:8765

Deploy 'production' branch to localhost:

    %MAIN% http://localhost production
