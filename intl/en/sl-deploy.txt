usage: {{%MAIN% [options] [URL [PACK|BRANCH]]}}

Deploy a node application to a StrongLoop process manager

Options:
  {{-h,--help}}          Print this message and exit.
  {{-v,--version}}       Print version and exit.
  {{-s,--service SVC}}   Deploy to service {{SVC}}.
  {{-z,--size SIZE}}     Set size of cluster to {{SIZE}} before deploy.

Arguments:
  {{SIZE}}: A number, n, or the string '{{cpus}}', meaning run a worker per CPU.

  {{SVC}}: The name or ID of the service on the process manager.

    Defaults to the name of the application specified in the {{package.json}} file.

    If a service with that name is not available on the process manager, a new service will be created and the application will be deployed.

  {{URL}}: The {{URL}} of the StrongLoop process manager.

    Defaults to `{{http://localhost:8701}}`. If a {{URL}} is provided, both the host and port is optional, they default to `{{localhost}}` and 8701, respectively. If the server requires authentication, the credentials must be part of the URL, see examples.

    URL may also use the `{{http+ssh://}}` protocol which will connect using {{ssh}} and then tunnel the http requests over that connection. The {{ssh username}} will default to your current user and authentication defaults to using your current {{ssh-agent}}. The {{username}} can be overridden by setting an `{{SSH_USER}}` environment variable. The authentication can be overridden to use an existing private key instead of an agent by setting the `{{SSH_KEY}}` environment variable to the path of the private key to be used. The port used for ssh can be overridden by setting an `{{SSH_PORT}}` environment ariable.

  {{PACK}}: Deploy an {{NPM package/tarball}}.

  {{BRANCH}}: Deploy a {{git}} branch.

Default behaviour is to deploy to `{{http://localhost:8701}}`. An {{npm}} package from the parent directory is deployed, if one is found for the current application version, otherwise the {{git}} branch `{{deploy}}` is deployed.

Note that if {{PACK}} or {{BRANCH}} is specified, {{URL}} *must* be specified as well.

Examples:

Deploy the default {{npm}} package or {{git}} branch to {{localhost}}:

    {{%MAIN%}}

Deploy the default {{npm}} package or {{git}} branch to a remote host:

    {{%MAIN% http://prod1.example.com}}

Deploy to a remote host, on a non-standard port, using authentication:

    {{%MAIN% http://user:pass@prod1.example.com:8765}}

Deploy '{{production}}' branch to {{localhost}}:

    {{%MAIN% http://localhost production}}
